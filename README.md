## 💼 Cybersecurity & Machine Learning Gigs

### 🔐 Security-Focused Development
- Designed and implemented an advanced **image encryption system** leveraging **chaotic maps** (e.g., Logistic, Tent, or Henon maps) to generate highly secure, non-linear cryptographic keys.
- Integrated chaotic key generation with pixel-level transformations to encrypt images with **high sensitivity, entropy, and resistance to brute-force and statistical attacks**.
- Applied principles from information theory and cryptography to simulate and analyze system robustness for secure image transmission and storage.
- Explored **information system assurance**, secure coding practices, and cryptographic algorithm design in academic and applied settings.

### 🤖 Applied Machine Learning & AI
- Intern @ **The Sparks Foundation**: Developed machine learning pipelines using **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **pandas**, focusing on regression/classification tasks and model performance optimization.
- Built and trained CNN-based models for **plant disease detection**, integrating **real-time image processing** and **predictive analysis** into a user-friendly web platform.
- Developed an **end-to-end ML-powered full stack application** where users upload images of plant leaves through a web interface to:
  - 🔍 **Detect the disease**,
  - 💊 **Display the cure**, and
  - 🛡️ **Recommend preventive measures** to avoid recurrence.
- Implemented **data pipelines**, **data preprocessing**, and **visualization dashboards** to monitor model behavior and performance metrics.

### 🧪 Automation & Quality Engineering
- Completed professional training in **Automation Testing** using **Java and Selenium**, improving QA efficiency for backend and ML-integrated systems.
- Designed automated test cases for web apps and model-serving interfaces, ensuring **end-to-end functionality**, **data integrity**, and **user experience reliability**.
- Built reusable test suites to simulate real-world user behavior and validate robustness across system components.
